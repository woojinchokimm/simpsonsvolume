## Overview

**simpsonsvolume** is a toolbox used for volumetric analysis of 3D anatomical meshes of the **left ventricle**. The meshes are reconstructed a retrospective cohort representative of:

* an adult population [UK Biobank Imaging Study](http://imaging.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)
* a young population (preterm) 
* an elderly heart failure population.

These meshes have been made publicly available [here](dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14933463)
